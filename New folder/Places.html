                    <!--<p>Niagara Falls is Canada's most famous natural attraction, bringing in millions of visitors each year. Located just over an hour's drive from Toronto, along the American border, these massive falls drop approximately 57 meters. You can see the falls at an astoundingly close distance from several key points.
                    Niagara Falls and the Niagara Gorge have been attracting tourists and daredevils for well over a century. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries there were numerous attempts to plunge over the falls in various types of homemade boats and barrels. This, along with tightrope walkers and other spectacles, led to the adjacent town of Niagara Falls developing a carnival type atmosphere that still persists today.</p>

                    <!--<p> No doubt, when it comes to Canadian cribs, Casa Loma is ‘house goals’. Meaning ‘Hill House’, this stunning former estate of one of Canada’s biggest businessmen is now owned by the city of Toronto.
                    Casa Loma was built in 1914 and remains one of the city’s proudest historical landmarks.  And it has it all; from secret passageways to grand ballrooms and towers, to its gorgeous grounds, it really is a mini castle right in the city. It’s one of Canada’s most beautiful buildings, and it’s the perfect place to explore on an afternoon. Keep it in mind if you’re planning out your free time on our trip through Ontario & Quebec in a Week.</p>-->

The limestone hill is home to our Parliament Buildings and the Centennial Flame, and it’s a stunning spot to visit. The three beautiful historic Gothic buildings of the Parliament were built between 1866 and 1927. See their beauty for yourself when you visit Ottawa on our trip through Ontario & Quebec in a Week.</p>-->

Ouimet is about 100 meters deep and provides a beautiful combo of golden forests and rock formations. Plus, you’ll find amazing trails and lookout points in the park and have the chance to see arctic plant life as well in the canyon.</p>-->

                    At the top, you can find fine dining in the revolving 360 restaurant, and enjoy a meal while looking out over the city and lake. The LookOut and the Glass Floor offer beautiful views out over the entire area. For an added thrill, consider stepping outside of the enclosed area onto the metal walkway for the CN Tower Edgewalk. You'll be harnessed in and then be able to walk around the building, 116 stories or 356 meters (1,168 feet) above the ground below.</p>-->
