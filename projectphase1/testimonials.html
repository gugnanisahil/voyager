    <section> From archaeological adventures on land to expert led gulet cruises and private charters, we like to think
        we offer the very finest cultural tours and holidays – but we are always trying to improve.<br><br>

        Our clients come from very different walks of life and age groups. We’re delighted that many come back to travel
        on our escorted historical tours and small group cruises again and again. We feel that their testimonials
        describe who we are and what we do far better than we ever could. Here’s a small selection.<br><br>

            favourite family trip."<br><br>

            <h4>Gulet Charter in Greece</h4>

            "Our gulet cruise from Kos to Patmos was everything and more than expected. It lived up to the Peter Sommer
            Travels' emphasis on culture, history, archaeology, comfort and camaraderie."<br><br>

            <h4>Cruising To The Cyclades</h4>
            "Peter Sommer runs a a highly professional organization. From his brochure to drop off at the airport to fly
            home his attention to detail and his consideration for his clients is superb. The archaeologists he uses as
            guides are erudite but highly personable and have an ability to turn a pile of stones into a recreation of
            the lives of the people who lived there over two millennia ago. Excellent."<br><br>

            "This was our fourth trip with Peter Sommer Travels and it lived up to our very high expectations. It was a
            wonderfully organized trip with beautiful cruising and swimming spots, great hikes, and fascinating lectures
            on the region and history. The ship was beautiful, comfortable, and excellently crewed. The guide was
            wonderfully informed and participated enthusiastically in all the activities. A shout-out also to the local
            guides who each brought their own perspective. Excellent."<br><br>

            <h4>Walking And Cruising Southern Dalmatia</h4>
            "This was the first time I had travelled with Peter Sommer Travels. The company specialises in expert-led
            cultural and gulet tours in Europe. Group numbers are small, accommodation comfortable and food excellent.
            The expert guide who accompanied us was outstanding - passionate, informative, engaging and entertaining.
            The itinerary was very well thought out, combining leisure time with activity and not-to-be-missed
            opportunities to swim in the Adriatic sea off the gulet. The client is obviously at the heart of the
            itinerary planning, and attention to detail is second to none. I would highly recommend this company to
            anyone wanting a fun, relaxed, educational holiday with fine food - they will deliver!"<br><br>

            <h4>Exploring The Peloponnese</h4>
            "The combination of the archaeology, the food and wine experiences, the swimming 
            and the generally relaxed atmosphere made for a very enjoyable tour. There was a 
            high attention to detail. Our main tour guide was
            very enthusiastic and highly qualified. Excellent."<br><br>
